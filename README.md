# ðŸ‘‹ Hello on my GitHub profile!
I'm creating some random models in my spare time.

ðŸ§  Iâ€™m deeply interested in NLP & LLM technology and how they're revolusionizing the world. 
Iâ€™m currently learning how to implement different LLM models locally, aiming to mitigate risks associated with online data leaks or vulnerabilities.
